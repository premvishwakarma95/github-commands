## What is Git?
- Git is software.
- Git is a version control system.
- It helps developers track changes in their code over time.
- Think of Git like a time machine for your code ⏳
- With Git, you can:
- Track who changed what and when
- Go back to previous versions of code
- Work on new features safely using branches
- Merge code from multiple developers without conflicts (or handle them properly)
- 👉 Git works locally on your computer.
